<p align="center"> This is the first assignment I did in term 5 of my Computer Engineering undergrad degree.
    <br> This assignment uses object oriented programming concepts to build a visual expression plotter. 
    <br> Made for the course ECE 5010 Software Design.

## :thinking: Why Use it? 

Because plots are cool when your computer does the computation. :stuck_out_tongue: :nerd_face:

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the first assignment of the course ECE 5010 Software Design. This assignment was done in the second week of class in my 5th term as a computer engineering student. This assignment uses object oriented programming concepts in Java to make a math 
expression plotter. The IDE that was used was Eclipse and I suggest that you use Eclipse as well to pull this project down. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Eclipse for your IDE
You will also need the latest JAVA JDK

### Installing

It's important that you first install Java before Eclipse.  

```
Step 1: Install the latest Java JDK from here. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
```

```
Step 2: Install Eclipse from here.( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once Eclipse and Java are installed. Open the project in your eclipse workspace and run the project PlotterMain.java file which 
can be found in the following directory (/ExpressionsAndPlotting/src/plotter). You should see the calculator pop up when you run the file.
